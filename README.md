Welcome to my Automation model for Face Mask Detection.
Here you will learn how to use Automation for the Deployment of a Machine Learning model.

Prerequisites:

1)JUPYTER NOTEBOOK - pip install notebook (Python virtual environment(Anaconda) preinstalled) https://jupyter.org/install
2)PYTHON PACKAGES : Commands to install in Jupyter notebook
	a) TENSORFLOW - pip install tensorflow 
	b) OPENCV - pip install opencv-python 
	c) FLASK - pip install flask 
3) PYCHARM - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

  
TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES: 

1) GITHUB
2) AWS CODEPIPLINE
3) JENKINS
4) AWS ELASTIC BEANSTALK
5) PYCHARM
  

DOCUMENTATION:

1) [AWS CODEPIPELINE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/index.html)
2) [JENKINS (ON SERVER AWS EC2)](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/tutorial-for-installing-jenkins-on-AWS/)
3) [AWS ELASTIC BEANSTALK]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elastic-beanstalk/index.html)

STEPS FOR AUTOMATION:
1)Log in to your AWS account.
2)Create an EC2 and install Jenkins.
3)Log in to your Github account and create a repository.
4)Create an AWS Codepipline with source as Github, build using jenkins ,deploy on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.


EXECUTION:
1)Create an ML model and integrate with Flask Webframe Application.
2)Push this code in your repository,then AWS Codepipline will compile,build and deploy the code.
3)Your website is ready to use.

Enjoy!All the best!!
